# Ultrasonic-Levitator
Ù‘Float objects using sound waves and of course with the help of Arduino board.

## What it DO!
In this tutorial, we are going to teach you how to float objects using sound waves. And of course with the help of the Arduino board. If you're interested in social media, most likely projects called "ultrasonic levitator" or "acoustic levitator" Have you seen the sound traction device?

### Items needed
-Ultrasonic Transmitter
-Arduino
-L298 Driver

### Ultrasonic Transmitter
If you have ever worked with ultrasonic modules, for example SRF05, you have noticed that two ultrasonic sensors are used in this group of modules, one to send waves and the other to receive that using the same wave travel can easily distance projects. Sensors are made, if you disassemble these sensors, two letters R or T are printed on the back of these sensors. We need a T or Transmitter type to make this project. The R type are the receivers.

## How it Works!
When the transducers are connected to the driver, they hear a quiet but annoying sound in the long run, that is, a device that actually makes a standing wave (standing wave) at the peak of the sound, resulting in the desired components.
